# Summary

This analysis does not find a strong bias for reviews in the Amazon Vine program. Out of the 40,565 total reviews, only 94 of them were from paid reviews. While there were a greater percentage of 5 star reviews for paid is 51.06% than unpaid is 38.70%, this is a relatively small difference and the sample size of paid reviews is too small . To conclude that, there should be further examined by looking at the distribution of all star-levels across paid and unpaid reviews. Also, for a more deatiled analysis, this same analysis should be conducted across a few different product catagories.
